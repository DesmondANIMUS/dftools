#### üì¢ Some Important Concepts

- Digital Forensics: An applicaiton of science to uncover facts, solve crime by **acquiring** the evidence <br />
**analyzing** the evidence and finally prepping it for any court of law. All the steps must be completed while <br /> maintaining the [chain of custody](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/tags/chain-of-custody) and **integrity**.

- Forensic Image/Copy: This term refers to a **bit perfect** copy/clone of any storage device.<br/>
It is important to understand that any forensic cloning tool worth it's salt would ensure integrity of evidence. <br />
This is why in forensic terms a simple backup is not enough.

- Data recovery tools look into unallocated sectors to find the files that were thought to be lost. They reach out <br />
to a very low level, below all the abstraction layers.
